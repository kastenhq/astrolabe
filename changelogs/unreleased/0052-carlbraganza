Added support for GVDDK QueryAllocatedBlocks and updated the package unit tests to 7.0.

The VDDK Programming Guide describes the use of this method and how to use it with QueryDiskChangedAreas
in the general case.
(https://code.vmware.com/docs/11750/virtual-disk-development-kit-programming-guide/GUID-152B7BA2-5A08-4044-A0FB-8DAACB39C4E1.html)

When applied to FCDs, the QueryAllocatedBlocks method is likely to be most useful in full
backups as device blocks are likely to be relatively sparsely allocated initially.  It is 
less useful on incremental backups when change block tracking is enabled on an FCD because 
the QueryDiskChangedAreas function returns allocation layout information that is either 
logically identical to or a subset of that returned by the QueryAllocatedBlocks function.
